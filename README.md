# BEP examples
This repository includes code examples used in my Bachelor End Project (BEP).

This directroy shows examples of the Beam module in SymPy 1.12.1. There is also a calculation present that uses SymPy 1.12.1 functions. To install this SymPy version and the other requirements use `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
